Questions 4 Celeste:

 1. I cannot seem to target the icon to change it's size. It may be because im tired, but I really took time to inspect it and can't find why it isn't working?

 2. Do we want more space between the cards in mobile view?

 3. Why does the bottom portion of the card appear to have a smaller amount of margin and padding even though it is even on all sides?

 4. Why can't i get it to line up in 2 x 2 cards on the 768 media query. I prob need ot go to bed. smfh
